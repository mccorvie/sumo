## Introduction

Sumo, Japan’s national sport, has centuries of tradition and a highly structured system of competition.

This webpage explores wrestler performance through [**Elo ratings**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system), a method commonly used in chess and video games to track relative skill over time.

The goal is to see how well Elo captures wrestler strength compared to the official banzuke (ranking) system. Elo scores can help gauge the relative strength of rikishi in a given match, and provide a fuller picture of a wrestler's record than a simple win-loss record. Elo can also help track the prowess of a wrestler over time, showing trends in performance.


## Background 

### Sumo

Elo ratings provide a way of updating a competitor’s strength based on match outcomes, rewarding unexpected victories more heavily.

In the context of sumo:

-   Wrestlers compete in six *honbasho* (grand tournaments) per year, in each of the odd-numbered months
-   Each top-division wrestler fights 15 bouts per basho.
-   The Japan Sumo Association publishes the official [*banzuke*](https://sumo.or.jp/EnHonbashoBanzuke/index/) ranking before each tournament, based on recent records and judgment by the ranking committee.

This project applies Elo to sumo bouts to compare a statistical rating system with the traditional banzuke.

### Elo Calculations

Wrestlers are assigned an initial Elo rating of **1500**, a common baseline in Elo systems.  Each bout updates the wrestlers’ ratings based on the expected outcome vs. the actual result.  

The Elo system is built on **log-odds**: the difference in ratings corresponds to the logarithm of the expected odds. A difference of **400 points** means the higher-rated wrestler is expected to win about 90% of the time — equivalent to **10-to-1 odds**.  

The formula for expected win probability of Wrestler A against Wrestler B is:  

$$
P(A \text{wins}) = \frac{1}{1 + 10^{-(R_A - R_B)/400}}
$$

Where \(R_A\) and \(R_B\) are the Elo ratings of the two wrestlers.

Here is a quick reference table converting Elo differences into win probabilities and approximate betting odds:

| Elo Difference | Win Probability | Approx. Odds   |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 400            | 90.1%           | 10-to-1        |
| 200            | 76%             | 3-to-1         |
| 100            | 64%             | 7-to-4 (≈2-to-1) |
| 50             | 57%             | 4-to-3         |

Intuitively, small rating gaps imply relatively even contests, while large gaps indicate overwhelming favorites.



## Elo History for Selected Wrestlers

One way to appreciate the Elo system is to track how ratings evolve for individual wrestlers across their careers.  

### Example: Hakuho

- Hakuho is widely regarded as the most dominant Yokozuna in modern sumo.  
- His Elo score peaked at extraordinary levels, reflecting long streaks of dominance.

### Other Notable Wrestlers

You may also include charts for wrestlers such as:  
- Taiho  
- Chiyonofuji  
- Asashoryu  
- Takanohana

## Calibration

This section explains how the Elo system was tuned for sumo:  
- What starting rating was chosen?  
- How were K-factors (update sensitivity) selected?  
- Did we adjust for era or tournament format changes?  
- Were special cases (e.g., fusen wins by default) treated differently?  

Calibration ensures that Elo ratings reflect meaningful comparisons across eras.

## Technical Details

For readers interested in methodology:  
- **Data sources:** historical sumo bout records (e.g., SumoDB, official sumo records).  
- **Computation:** implemented in R/Python with standard Elo update formulas.  
- **Visualization:** time series and summary statistics presented with Quarto.  
- **Limitations:** ratings cannot fully capture injuries, absences, or qualitative factors (such as pressure on Yokozuna).
